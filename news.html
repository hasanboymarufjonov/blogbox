            <h3 class="post-head">Can my brain and myself be different?</h3>
            <p class="post">
            Sometimes my brain is something else and I am something else.
            I think so. Most people divide this condition into the concepts of
            “heart” and “brain”. This is definitely wrong. The heart is a muscular
            organ about the size of a fist, located just behind and slightly left
            of the breastbone. The heart pumps blood through the network
            of arteries and veins called the cardiovascular system.
            The heart cannot think. But then who am I? What is myself?
            What do I do if my brain commands? Does the whole process take
            place only in the brain? These questions make many wonder?
            But not me. I know the answer. I am a ghost myself. I have a body and a ghost.
            While my body is dependent on this temporary life, my ghost is dependent on eternal life. 
            Everything is simple. Atheists are still thinking. They just don’t want to admit it. 
            <b>Acknowledging our weakness saves us from weakness.</b>
